This page contains the development progress of [jsyang](http://www.jsyang.ca)'s entry for the
[/r/ProceduralGeneration July 2016 challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/4rom1n/monthly_challenge_8_july_2016_procedural_creatures/).


Below are the steps I've taken to reach the end products with inline sub-steps to illustrate an
instance of running this simulation.

At the end of all this I would like to be left with:
 - a full progression of steps leading to a set of procedurally generated creatures
 - a plausible world and environments that contain these creatures
 - most recent relationships between the different species (if any)
 - an evolutionary tree depicting the evolution of such creatures

## World generation
Before we can start generating creatures, we need to define characteristics of the environments
they will live in. To do this we need to generate a world and then environments within that world
so the creatures that are created don't seem as contrived.
